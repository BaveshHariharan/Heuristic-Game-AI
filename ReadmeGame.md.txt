Project Description

This folder contains the core game engine and logic for handling the board, movement, and gameplay rules.
It defines how the pieces move, how turns are managed, and how the AI interacts with the grid.

WHAT THE PRORAM DOES:
Defines the main Game and GameImpl classes that manage the overall game flow.
Uses Grid and GridImpl for representing and updating the board state.
Implements Move and MoveImpl for handling valid moves and transitions.
Includes a Pathfinder for movement and route validation.
Manages piece colors, player turns, and victory conditions.

SKILLS AN KNOWLEDGE DEMOSTRATED:
Object-Oriented Programming in Java (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
Interface and implementation separation (e.g., Game / GameImpl, Grid / GridImpl)
Game logic and board management using data structures
Pathfinding algorithms for piece movement validation
Modular architecture to separate AI logic from game engine
Clean code design and class interaction in a multi-class project
