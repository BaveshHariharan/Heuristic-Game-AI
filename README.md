# Heuristic-Game-AI
Java-based strategy game featuring AI opponent built with Minimax algorithm and heuristic evaluations.

WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES:
  Implements the Minimax algorithm to simulate decision trees and predict the player’s moves.
  Uses heuristics such as minPiecesHeuristic to evaluate board positions and determine the best possible action.
  Handles AI move generation, scoring, and turn decisions in real time.
  Integrates seamlessly with the core game engine for an interactive Player vs AI gameplay mode.

SKILS AND KNOWLEDGE DEMONSTRADED:  
  Strong understanding of Artificial Intelligence concepts
  Implemented Minimax algorithm for strategic decision-making
  Designed heuristic evaluation functions to guide AI choices
  Applied game tree traversal and recursion
  Integrated AI with the main game loop using clean OOP design principles

WHAT THIS FILE CONTAINS:
  This file contains 2 branches one for AI and one for GAME
  > MAIN branch contains the artificial intelligence logic that powers the computer-controlled opponent in the game.
    It uses Minimax, heuristic evaluations, and game-state analysis to make intelligent move decisions against the human player.
  > GAME branch contains the core game engine and logic for handling the board, movement, and gameplay rules.
    It defines how the pieces move, how turns are managed, and how the AI interacts with the grid.
